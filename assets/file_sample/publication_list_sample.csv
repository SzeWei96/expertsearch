Hand-based multibiometric system is the most successful and used in many real time systems especially law enforcement and forensics. Moreover, it is very user friendly and ease of use among all other biometric traits. Multi classifier fusion is the use of more classifiers for each modality involved rather than single at the score fusion of multibiometric system. Furthermore, hand-based multimodal biometrics can use either or all traits of fingerprint, palm print, finger vein, palm vein, dorsal vein, hand geometry, finger knuckle print and many more. In this paper, we reviewed various score normalization techniques and multi-classifiers used in the hand-based multimodal biometrics for each modality involved at the matching score fusion for enhancing the system performance further. © 2017 IEEE.",Multi-classifier; Multimodal biometrics; Score fusion,Biometrics; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Biometrie systems; Finger knuckle prints; Intra-class variation; Multi-classifier; Multi-modal biometrics; Multibiometric systems; Score fusion; Score normalization; Signal processing,,,,,,,"Wozniak, M., A survey of multi-classifier as hybrid systems (2014) Information Fusion; Aravinth, J., Valarmathy, S., Multi classifier-based score level fusion of multi-modal biometric recognition and its application to remote biometrics authentication (2016) The Imaging Science Journal, 64 (1), pp. 1-14; Saigaa, M., (2014) Hand-based Biometric for Personal Identification Using Correlation Filter Classifier, , Taylor & Francis Group, LLC; Ramalho, M., Secure multispectral hand recognition system (2011) European Signal Processing Conference, Spain; Zhu, L.Q., (2010) Multimodal Biometric Identification System Based on Finger Geometry, Knuckle Print, and Palm Print, , pattern recognition letters; Peng, J., Multimodal biometric authentication based on score level fusion of finger biometrics (2014) Optik; Karthik, Score Level Fusion using Hybrid BF-pfPSO for Face and Fingerprint Multimodal Biometric System (2016) IEEE Conference Proceedings, ICECS; Bharathi, S., Hand Vein-based Multimodal Biometric Recognition (2015) Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 12 (6); Sumathi, S., Multimodal Biometrics for Person Authentication using Hand Image (2013) Ijca, 70 (24). , May; Nandakumar, R.K., Jain, A.K., (2006) Handbook of Multibiometrics, , Springer, New York, USA, 1st edition; Esther, A multimodal biometric system based on palm print and finger knuckle print recognition methods (2015) An International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 12 (2). , March; Kumar, A., Personal authentication using finger knuckle surface (2009) IEEE Trans.

Unfortunately, the awareness of early sign of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is still insufficiently provided to the public. Arm flapping is a good example of a stereotypical behavior of ASD early sign. Typically, a standard Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBSR) - set of questionnaire - used by clinicians for ASD diagnosis usually involved multiple and long sessions that apparently would delay and may have nonconformity. Thus, we aim to propose a computational framework to semi-automate the diagnosis process. We used human action recognition (HAR) algorithm. HAR involved in human body detection and the skeleton representation to show the arm asymmetrical in arm flapping movement which indicates the possibility of ASD signs by extracting the body pose into stickman model. The proposed framework has been tested against the video clips of children performing arm flapping behavior taken from public dataset. The outcome of this study is expected to detect early sign of ASD based on asymmetry measurement of arm flapping behavior. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Arm flapping; ASD early detection; Autism spectrum disorder; Body postures; HAR algorithm; Skeleton representation,Musculoskeletal system; Arm flapping; Asymmetry measurements; Autism spectrum disorders; Body postures; Computational framework; Human-action recognition; Skeleton representation; Stereotypical behavior; Diseases,,,,,,,"McCary, L.M., Grefer, M., Mounts, M., Roberts, J.E., (2012) The Importance of Differential Diagnosis in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Implications for Idea, , American Psychological Association, Washington, D.C; Mesibov, G., Adams, L., Klinger, L., (1997) Autism: Understanding the Disorder, , Plenum Press, New York; Schertz, H.H., Baker, C., Hurwitz, S., Benner, L., Principles of early intervention reflected in toddler research in autism spectrum disorders (2011) Top.

Adaptive step size is introduced instead of fixed step size by random walk of the Fire Fly Algorithm (FFA) in the tumble move of the bacterium at the chemo-taxis stage of BFO. So that, the slow convergence of the BFO algorithm is mitigated. PSO algorithm is acted as mutation operator to attain the global best. So, the trapping out in the local optima by PSO is being avoided. BFO algorithm is used to attain the local best optimality. The new algorithm is tested on a set of benchmark functions. The proposed hybrid algorithm is compared with the original BFO and PSO algorithm. It has been proved that the proposed algorithm shows the significance than the classical BFO and PSO algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Fire fly algorithm; Particle swarm optimization,Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Adaptive step size; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Bacterial swarm optimizations; Benchmark functions; Mutation operators; Optimization algorithms; Slow convergences; Optimization,,,,,,,"Alostaz, A., Alhanjouri, M., A new adaptive BFO based on PSO for learning neural network.

By incorporating prior knowledge about the organelle's morphology and image features, the required number of parameter tweaking can be reduced substantially. In practical applications, however, the general organelles' features are often known in advance, yet the actual organelles' morphology is not elaborated. Two primary contributions of this paper are firstly the classification of insulin granules based on its image features and morphology for accurate segmentation - mainly focused at pre-processing image segmentation and secondly the new hybrid meshing quantification is presented. The method proposed in this study is validated on a set of manually defined ground truths. The study of insulin granules in particular; the location, and its image features has also opened up other options for future studies.",,,,,,,,,"Olofsson, C.S., Salehi, A., Holm, C., Rorsman, P., Palmitate increases l- Type ca2+ currents and the size of the readily releasable granule pool in mouse pancreatic beta- cells (2004) Journal of Physiology, 557, pp. 935-948; Hutton, J.C., The insulin secretory granule (1989) Diabetologia, 32, pp. 271-281; Howell, S.L., The molecular organization of the beta granule of the islets of langerhans (1974) Advances in Cytopharmacology, 2, pp. 319-327; Ladinsky, M.S., Wu, C.C., Mcintosh, S., Mcintosh, J.R., Howell, K.E., Structure of the golgi and distribution of reporter molecules at 20 degrees c reveals the complexity of the exit compartments (2002) Molecular Biology of the Cell, 13, pp. 2810-2825; Marsh, B.J., Lessons from tomographic studies of the mammalian golgi (2005) Biochemical and Biophysics Acta, 1744, pp. 273-292; Russ, J.C., Dehoff, R.T., (2000) Practical Stereology, , New York, Kluwer Academic/Plenum; Derganc, J., Mironov, A.A., Svetina, S., Physical factors that affect the number and size of golgi cisternae (2006) Traffic, 7, pp. 85-96; Griffiths, G., Fuller, S.D., Back, R., Hollinshead, M., Pfeiffer, S., Simons, K., The dynamic nature of the golgi complex (1989) Journal of Cell Biology, 108, pp. 277-297; Marsh, B.J., Mastronarde, D.N., Buttle, K.F., Howell, K.E., Mcintosh, J.R., Organellar relationships in the golgi region of the pancreatic beta cell line, hit t15, visualized by high resolution electron tomography (2001) Proceedings of the National Academy of Science U S a, 98, pp. 2399-2406; Ladinsky, M.S., Mastronarde, D.N., Mcintosh, J.R., Howell, K.E., Staehelin, L.A., Golgi, structure in three dimensions: Functional insights from the normal rat kidney cell (1999) Journal of Cell Biology, 144, pp. 1135-1149; Nurntan Raihana, R., (2014) Multiple, Object-oriented Segmentation Methods of Mammalian Cell Tomograms, , PhD Thesis, The University of Queensland; Rorsman, P., Renstrom, E., Insulin granule dynamics in pancreatic beta cells (2003) Diabetologia, 46, pp. 1029-1045; Noske, A.B., Costin, A.J., Morgan, G.P., Marsh, B.J., Expedited approaches to whole cell electron tomography and organelle mark-up in situ in high-pressure frozen pancreatic islets (2008) Journal of Structural, Biology, 161, pp. 298-313; Kremer, J.R., Mastronarde, D.N., Mcintosh, J.R., Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using imod (1996) Journal of Structural Biology, 116, pp. 71-76; Nurntan Raihana, R., Semi- Automated cellular tomogram segmentation workflow (ctsw): Towards an automaic target scoring system (2014) The International Conference on Computer Graphics, Multimedia and Image Processing",,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,,,,,21801843,,,,English,J.

To overcome these problems, a technique has been proposed to detect defects automatically and effectively using the image segmentation technique. Although, this technique has been well developed, it does suffer from several disadvantages of radiographic images taken to be poor in quality, as well as the microscopic size of the defects together with poor orientation relatively to the small size and thickness of the evaluated parts. Using image segmentation algorithm allows the defects to be automatically inspected and measured within the welded surface such as cracks, porosity and foreign inclusions, which may be weakening the welded parts. This paper proposes a system to automatically identifies and classifies the faults from the welding process by using the existing image segmentation algorithms. The output of the developed system produces a measured analysis which can be then used to describe the mechanical properties of welded part of the alloy such as its tensile and force. The benefits of this project will improve the welding process to reduce faults and defects for both constructing and manufacturing fields.",Automatic laser welding; Classification; Defect detection; Sobel-contour shape,,,,,,,,"Li, C.-T., Chiao, R., Multiresolution genetic clustering algorithm for texture segmentation (2003) Image and Vision Computing, 21 (11), pp. 955-966; Richardson, I.E., (2003) H.264 and MPEG-4 Video Compression: Video Coding for Next-generation Multimedia, , Wiley; Nejatpour, R., Sadabad, A.A., Automated weld defects detection using image processing and cad methods (2008) ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition; Parvati, K., Prakasa Rao, B.S., Mariya Das, M., Image segmentation using gray-scale morphology and marker-controlled watershed transformation (2008) Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society, p. 8; Singh, K., Singh, A., A study of image segmentation algorithms for different types of images (2010) IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science, (7), p. 5; Bala, A., An improved watershed image segmentation technique using matlab (2012) International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, (3), p. 6; Shen, J., (2012) Application of Image Segmentation In Inspection Of Welding-Practical research in MATLAB, , University Of Boras; Dass, R., Devi, P.S., Image segmentation techniques (2012) IJECT, 3 (1); Chaudhary, A., Gulati, T., Segmenting digital images using edge detection (2013) International Journal of Application of Innovation in Engineering & Management, 2 (5); (2013) WELDER'S Visual Inspection, pp. 32-33. , HANDBOOK; Narsimhachary, D., (2014) Effect of Laser Welding Parameters on 6061 Aluminium Alloy, , Department Of metallurgical And Materials Engineering, National Institute Of Technology Rourkela, Odisha-769008; Nand, G.K., Neogi, N.N., Defect detection of steel surface using entropy segmentation (2014) Annual IEEE India Conference, , Department of Electrical And Electronic Engineering, Birla Institute, Mesra, Ranchi-835215; Alam, M.A., Ali, M.M.N., Syed, M.A.A., Sorif, N., Rahaman, M.A., (2014) An Algorithm to Detect and Identify Defects of Industrial Pipes Using Image Processing, , Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), Chittagong, Bangladesh; Cogranne, R., Statistical detection of defects in radiographic images using an adaptive parametric model (2014) Signal Processing, 96 (8), pp. 173-189; Madani, S., Azizi, M., (2015) Detection of Weld Defects in Radiography Films Using Image Processing, (9); Che Jamil, M.S., Imam Fauzi, E.R., Juinn, C.S., Sheikh, M.A., Laser bending of pre-stressed thin-walled nickel microtubes (2015) Journal of Optics & Laser Technology, 73, pp. 105-117",,,,Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka,,,,,21801843,,,,English,J.
